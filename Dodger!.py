    Welcome to Dodger! This is a game made by Michael Varnerin for CSI 31.

    In this game, you will control a circular character and try to dodge fast-falling objects. If one of the objects hits you, it's Game Over!

    Please note that currently a bug exists that the program will only detect that the object hits into you WHILE YOU ARE MOVING. Therefore, be sure to continually move the mouse while playing
    until this bug is fixed.

    I hope you enjoy this game!
